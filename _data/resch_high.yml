- name: Herbal Antifungal Essential Oils Double Barrier Release
  Faculty: Dr. Mudrika Khandelwal
  img: /assets/images/high/MK3.png
  detail: Three antifungal essential oils have been co-encapsulated in microcapsules and embedded in a nanofibrous matrix. This enables a slow and controlled release of oils for prolonged activity, while protecting the oils from denaturation.
